Project Team Meeting - Project Goals
Dr. Yerro, Luis, Abdel, Kaleigh

Topic: Upgrading NorSand (2015) Constitutive Model:
1. 	Implement unloading surface – add an inclined yield surface? - Luis
2.	Degradation of elastic properties (implicit way of dealing with damping) - Kaleigh
3.	Softening due to rotation of principle stresses causes softening – important for  capturing cyclic loading (shrinking yield surface as a fxn of principal stresses, already hardens and softens but rate does not capture cyclic loading) - Abdel

Literature Review/Dataset Collection: 
- Abdel will focus on this
- Common benchmarks? Ishihara experimental tests?
- Book with constitutive model competition results and data?

Testing of Finished Model:
-	Try in Anura – create a very simple model
-	E.g. Apply on vertical column, change aspect ratio, input loading, etc.
-	Test each implementation separately
-	Could import into PLAXIS or FLAC to compare with other constitutive models.

Useful Tools in VisualStudio:
-	Extensions and Updates
    - Fortran CodeNav (can jump between subroutines)
        *Control Q on subroutine will take you to where subroutine is programmed
        *Alt Q takes you back to where subroutine is being called
    -	Visual Studio IntelliCode

Walk-Thru of NorSand UMAT Code: 
- Nor_Sand_Rate subroutine:
  - Compute state variables
  - Update elastic and state parameters due to strain rate (only if on elastic portion)
  - Elastic Procedure: check yield function and see if in elastic region or not
  - Elastic Unloading Procedure:
    - Find intersection of stress path with yield surface (but yield surface is moving) - uses Newton Method
    - Check elastic unloading - Pegasus method
- Substepping:
    - Centered FD approximation:
        - State variables assumed.
        - Increment of stress computed.
        - Increase in elastic strain computed and parameters softened.
        - Second approximation with update parameters.
- Stress Drift
  - Yield surface and point moved to meet each other to ensure point is not too far from  yield surface.
- GetdSiganddSP subroutine
  - follows Sloan et al. procedure
  - UpdateGandKdue2Erate
    - will need to create a new subroutine of similar form to update G and K due to degradation.
    
 For Implementation of Task 2: Degradation of elastic properties
 - Add one function at the beginning of substepping routine.
 - Compute G based on plastic deformation right before the elastic matrix is computed. 
 - Will need to add additional model parameters for inputs.
 - Keep same modulus for whole substepping routine, only update once at beginning.
 - Gmax changes with strain rate
 - Maybe try implementing more than one different degradation curve.
 - Calculate change in modulus dG for easier input into the rest of the code.
 
 For Implementation of Task 3: 
 - See Jeffries et al. 2015 "Soil Liquefaction: A Critical State Approach" Figure C7 and Eqn C.35
 - Update input parameters/state variables during plastic deformation because of changes in principal stresses. 
 - Must compute difference between previous alpha and new alpha. Need directional cosines. 
 - Must create a new state variable for alpha.
