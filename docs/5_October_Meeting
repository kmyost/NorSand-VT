Meeting Minutes
5 October 2020

Tasks Completed:
- Collection of data (Abdel)
- Development of a cubic function to describe transition zone of yield surface from straight to curved (Luis)

To Do:
- Luis will figure out why code compilation has syntax errors
- Luis will share Overleaf template for GSP
- Create a shared library in Zotero
- Luis will share incrementalDriver
- Kaleigh will compare DS and IZ curves already coded in Python with Abdel to check

Discussion:

How to use IncrementalDriver:
input files: test.inp, parameters.inp, initialconditions.inp

test.inp
- line  1 - name of output file
- line  2 - type of test (keyword)
- line  3 - test parameters: (increment to divide strain by, # of iter per step, total time: number of steps you want to write)
- line  4 - maximum strain (compression is negative)

initialconditions.inp
- line  1 - dimension of problem (e.g. 6 for initial stress tensor)
- line  2 through 8 - (sig1, sig2, sig3, tau1, tau2, tau3)
- line 9 - number of state variables of constitutive model UMAT (e.g. 23 currently)
- lines 10 ... - initialize state variables as zeros

parameters.inp
- line 1 - NORSAND (not used)
- line 2 - number of properties
- line 3 through (no. of properties) - each property in order specified in UMAT

to run: double click incremental driver .exe
note: if error, deformation too large, maybe increments are too big...
